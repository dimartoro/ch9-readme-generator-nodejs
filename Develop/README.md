## Installation
Clone to your local computer the Readme Generator command-line application located in my remote repository at https://github.com/dimartoro/ch9-readme-generator-nodejs.git . Open your Windows CMD in your local computer and write CD until your CMD displays the Develop directory located inside the directory ch9-readme-generator-nodejs. Inside the Develop directory write in the CMD the command dir to validate the index.js file, the executable file of the program, is there. After validated, in CMD write node index.js and start answering the questions that with your answers will generate the Readme for your project. Continue looking the video at the bottom that will walk you through the step by step Readme Generator command-line functionality.
